% Solving nxn system of linear differential equations


A = [2, 0, 0;-6, 8, 3; 18, -18, -7]


% Step1: get eigenvalues
[V, D] = eig(A)


% Step2: for the first eigenvalue, find a basis for NS (L - A)
B1 = diag(-1 * ones(3, 1)) - A


rref([B1, [0; 0; 0]])


% From this we can see that [0; -1/3; 1] is a basis



% Step3: find a basis for all other eigenvalues (only 2)

B2 = diag(2 * ones(3, 1)) - A



% Step4: a solution ("normal mode") is of the form dx/dt = e^L * v, where v is a solution


% Step4: the general solution is the linear combination of all solutions.
