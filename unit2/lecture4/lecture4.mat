# Creating a tridiagonal matrix

%Enter the matrix A. (Hint it may be useful to look up the 
%matlab documentation on diagonal and tridiagonal matrices.)
A = diag(1/3 * ones(9, 1), -1) + diag(1/3 * ones(9, 1), 1) + diag(1/3 * ones(10, 1), 0)
A(1, 1) = 2/3
A(10, 10) = 2/3


%Enter column vector of the initial state in a vector called c0.
c0 = zeros(10, 1)
c0(1, 1) = 1000

%Store the expected distribution of walkers after one time step in a vector called x1.
x1 = A * c0

%Store the expected distribution of walkers after two time steps in a vector called x2.
x2 = A^2 * c0

%Store the expected distribution of walkers after 9 time steps in a vector called x9.
x9 = A^9 * c0

[V, D] = eig(A)


# We are interested in the steady state behavior
[V, D] = eig(A)

D_inf = D^100000

x_inf = V * D_inf * V^(-1) * c0



# Explicit formula for fibonacci sequence

M = [1, 1;1 , 0]

[V, D] = eig(M)
